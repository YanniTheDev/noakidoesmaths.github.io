Hey Noaki, I just left this text file to tell you what I changed. Feel free to delete this file if you want.

I changed main.html to index.html, otherwise GitHub will not deploy your website.

I changed the styles so that the footer is always at the bottom so even if you don't have much content
between the header and footer, the footer will still be at the bottom. I did this by using flex display properties.
You can search up what they are.

I also just restructured the code so it is easier to navigate.

I won't change too much, I'll just occasionally have a look at the code and make it tidier.

Have fun coding big bro!
